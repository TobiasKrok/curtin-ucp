# Exercises to Improve Your Skills in Using Arrays and Pointers in C

Becoming proficient in arrays and pointers in C89 requires practice through various exercises. Here are some exercises that will help you get better at using arrays and pointers in C:

## Array basics:

- [x] Declare, initialize, and print an integer array of size 10.
- [x] Calculate and print the sum and average of elements in the array.

## Dynamic memory allocation:

- [x] Allocate memory for an integer array of size 10 using `malloc` or `calloc`.
- [x] Fill the array with random values and print the array.
- [x] Free the memory allocated using `free`.

## Pointers and arrays:

- [x] Write a function that takes an array and its size as input and returns the sum of the elements using pointer arithmetic.
- [x] Write a function that takes an array and its size as input and returns the largest and smallest elements using pointer arithmetic.

## String manipulation:

- [x] Write a function to find the length of a string using pointers.
- [x] Write a function to concatenate two strings using pointers.
- [ ] Write a function to reverse a string using pointers.
- [ ] Write a function to find a substring in a given string using pointers.

## Array of pointers:

- [ ] Create an array of pointers to store strings.
- [ ] Write a function to sort an array of strings alphabetically using pointers.

## Pointer to pointer:

- [ ] Write a function that takes a pointer to a pointer and swaps the values of the two pointers.
- [ ] Write a function that takes a pointer to a pointer and sorts a 2D array in ascending order.

## Passing arrays to functions:

- [ ] Write a function to calculate the length of a given array by passing the array as a parameter.
- [ ] Write a function to search for an element in a given array using pointers and return the index of the element if found.

## Function pointers:

- [ ] Declare a function pointer and use it to call a function that calculates the sum of two integers.
- [ ] Write a function that takes a function pointer as a parameter and uses it to perform an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction) on two integers.

Remember to start with simple exercises and gradually move on to more complex ones as you become comfortable with the concepts. Additionally, you can mark each item as done by placing an "x" in the brackets, like so:

- [x] Declare, initialize, and print an integer array of size 10.

Happy coding!
